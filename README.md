For this assighnment, the data structure I choose to utilize were one and two dimensional arrays. While using a list would probably have made removing duplicates easier, Instead I sorted my the data with the arr.sort method, and wrote a algorithm for removing duplicates, that was made much simpler by utizing the fact that the arrays were sorted I only needed to compare two elements at a time. This is due to sorted duplicates being forced to apear directly after the original. When removing duplicates from an unsorted array, the complexity is increased because each element much be checked against all 199 other elements since we dont know where the duplicates might occur.
