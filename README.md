  For the second assignment, I chose to primarily utilize one and two dimensional arrays. This data set works nicely with arrays becuase each line the outer array has the same set of elements inside it(1D array that hold 4 strings). This meant I was able to use some the structures that I build for the first assignment, by tweaking their paramenters to accept more data. For example when reading in the raw data I was able to populate the 2D array with the same nested for loops, with the counter variable tweaked so that it continues counting up after 200 (end of the first data set).

  In order to imitate a real playlist playback interface I included a user menu that allows the user to navigate the whole playlist by using N key for next and the P key for previous. While navigating the menu outputs not only the current song but the previous and next song too.
