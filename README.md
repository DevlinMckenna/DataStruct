 For the third assgnment I first attempted to utilize a Binary tree to store and sort the full list of 2000 movie titles. I was able to make a working binary tree for integers, and for strings that I wrote, however a ran into an issue when trying to import/read the data set of movie titles into the binary tree structure. eventually I decided instead, to utilize arrays and an user interface that imitates a binary tree by sorting the data, then displaying the middle element to the user and prompting them for input commands. these commands will allow the user to navigate by recursivly selecting either the upper or lower half of the data set, then sets the center element to the middle of the desired half:                           
 
                          ect...250 <--500 <--- 1000 --> 1500 --> 1750...ect.
                         
 so this is a bit of a workaround, Im not sure exactly why my intial attemps to read in the data set to a true binary tree did not work,(though I did not upload them)I could send you my non working versions too, if you want to see them let me know.
