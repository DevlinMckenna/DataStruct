<h1> Devlin Mckenna's about me page</h1>
<h2>Paragraph about devlin: </h2>
<h3>My name is Devlin Mckenna I am a transfer/second degree student in the copumter science program at brookyn college.
My previous school was SUNY Buffalo, where I completed my Bachelors degree in physics. I love the dicsipline,and plan to pursue higher level degree in the field, But before I invest more time and money into physics I've decided to explore Another interst of mine: Coding.
The physics ciriculum at my alma mater, gave us a cursory backround in C++ synatx and the logical structures used to create working programs. Not only did I enjoy learning this material, but I immediately appreciated its relavancy to my favorite past-time: video games.
